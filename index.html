                  <span>Once Forecasting is purchased and set to Active, forecast results will appear for all lane analyses. To change default settings for forecasting, click the pencil "edit" icon on the Rate Forecasting card under Settings > Rate Sources > Rate Market Place. Forecasted rates will always be returned as an average, but you can set whether you prefer them based at the State or 3-digit zip level. You can also set whether forecast results appear on the forecast graph on the Lane Details page in weeks or months and move the slider to set how many data points in the future you want returned. All default forecast settings can be overridden before an analysis is run right from the Less Than Bulk (Rates) page or on the last page of the bulk wizard when submitting a bulk request. You can also turn rate forecasting off at any time by clicking the Active toggle switch to set forecasting to Inactive.</span>
